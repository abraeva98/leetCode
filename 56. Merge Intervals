Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, 
and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

const merge = function(intervals) {
    intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0])
    let nonOverLappingIntervals = [];
    for (let interval of intervals) {
        if (nonOverLappingIntervals.length === 0 || 
            nonOverLappingIntervals[nonOverLappingIntervals.length - 1][1] < interval[0]) {
            nonOverLappingIntervals.push(interval)
        } else {
            nonOverLappingIntervals[nonOverLappingIntervals.length - 1][1] = Math.max(nonOverLappingIntervals[nonOverLappingIntervals.length - 1][1], interval[1])
        }
    }
    return nonOverLappingIntervals;
};
