Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a 
point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the 
two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, 
which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container 
contains the most water.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

var maxArea = function(height) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = height.length - 1;
    let maxArea = 0;
    while (left < right) {
        if (height[left] < height[right]) {
            let currMax = (right - left) * height[left];
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, currMax);
            left ++;
        } else {
            let rightMax = (right - left) * height[right];
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, rightMax);
            right --;
        }
    }
    return maxArea;
};
