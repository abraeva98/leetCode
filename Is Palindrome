Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

const isPalindrome = function(x) {
    let copy = x;
    let reversed = 0; 
    let current = 0; 
    while (copy > 0) {
        current = copy % 10;
        reversed = reversed * 10 + current;
        copy = Math.floor(copy / 10);
    } 
    return x === reversed;
};
