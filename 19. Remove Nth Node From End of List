Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

Follow up: Could you do this in one pass?

var removeNthFromEnd = function(head, n) {
    let dummy = new ListNode(0, head);
    let p1 = 0;
    let node1 = dummy;
    let node2 = dummy;
    while (p1 <= n) {
        node1 = node1.next;
        p1 ++;
    }
    while (node1 !== null) {
        node1 = node1.next;
        node2 = node2.next;
    }
    node2.next = node2.next.next;
    return dummy.next;
}
