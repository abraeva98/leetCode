Given numBottles full water bottles, you can exchange numExchange empty water bottles for one full water bottle.

The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

Return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.



var numWaterBottles = function(numBottles, numExchange) {
    let total = numBottles;
    let remainder = 0;  
    while (numExchange <= numBottles) {
        remainder = numBottles % numExchange;
        numBottles = Math.floor(numBottles / numExchange);
        total += numBottles;  
        numBottles += remainder;
    }
    return total;
};
